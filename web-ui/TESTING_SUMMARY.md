# VeritasAI Web UI Testing Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the testing implementation for the VeritasAI web UI, including unit tests, integration tests, and accessibility audits.

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests
- **Login Component**: Tests form rendering, field updates, loading states, and navigation
- **Register Component**: Tests form rendering, field updates, password validation, loading states, and navigation
- **Verification Component**: Tests form rendering, content type selection, field updates, loading states, and results
- **Header Component**: Tests responsive design and navigation functionality
- **Sidebar Component**: Tests responsive design and navigation functionality
- **ChartComponent**: Tests different chart types (bar, line, pie) and accessibility features
- **DashboardAnalytics**: Tests loading states, data rendering, and error states

### Integration Tests
- **Dashboard Integration**: Tests the complete dashboard with analytics components
- **Navigation Flow**: Tests navigation between different pages

### Accessibility Tests
- **Automated Audits**: Using axe-core to identify accessibility violations
- **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**: Testing for proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation

## Test Results
- **Passing Tests**: 35 tests
- **Failing Tests**: 3 tests
  1. Register page alert functionality
  2. DashboardAnalytics error state rendering
  3. Dashboard page accessibility violations

## Accessibility Issues Found
1. **ARIA progressbar nodes must have an accessible name** - CircularProgress components missing aria-label
2. **Heading levels should only increase by one** - Invalid heading order in dashboard
3. **List elements must only directly contain list items** - Invalid list structure in sidebar

## Recommendations
1. Fix the remaining test failures
2. Address the accessibility violations identified by axe-core
3. Consider adding more comprehensive integration tests for user workflows
4. Implement continuous integration for automated testing

## Tools Used
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- axe-core (jest-axe) for accessibility testing
- React Router for navigation testing
