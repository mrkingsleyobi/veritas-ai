# VeritasAI Technical Implementation Plan

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture Overview

VeritasAI will adopt a microservices-oriented architecture, enabling modularity, scalability, and independent deployment of components. This design ensures that different parts of the system can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, optimizing resource utilization and facilitating continuous integration and delivery.

The system will operate within a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, or Fly.io) to leverage managed services and ensure high availability and fault tolerance. The architecture will be designed to support both DigitalOcean and Fly.io deployments through containerization and infrastructure-as-code practices.

### 1.2 Core Components

1. **Client Applications**
   - Web UI (React.js/Next.js) with responsive design
   - Mobile applications (React Native)
   - CLI tool for power users and integration
   - Browser extension for real-time content verification

2. **API Gateway**
   - Acts as the single entry point for all client requests
   - Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, and SSL termination
   - Implements API versioning and request/response transformation

3. **Backend Services (Microservices)**
   - **User Service**: Manages user authentication, authorization, and profiles
   - **Ingestion Service**: Handles content uploads (direct, URL, API), initial validation, and storage
   - **Analysis Orchestration Service**: Manages the workflow of content analysis, dispatching tasks to specialized AI services
   - **AI Services**: Dedicated microservices for Image, Video, and Audio Analysis
   - **Reporting Service**: Generates detailed analysis reports and manages historical data
   - **Notification Service**: Handles user notifications (email, in-app, webhook)
   - **Billing Service**: Manages subscription plans, usage tracking, and payment processing

4. **Asynchronous Task Queue**
   - Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ for decoupling long-running analysis tasks
   - Ensures responsive API responses and scalable processing

5. **Databases**
   - **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database for user data, metadata, and analysis summaries
   - **Redis**: For caching, session management, and task queue processing
   - **Elasticsearch** (optional): For advanced search and analytics capabilities

6. **Object Storage**
   - MinIO/AWS S3 for storing raw and processed media files
   - Implements lifecycle policies for cost optimization

7. **MLOps Platform**
   - MLflow for experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment
   - DVC for data version control and reproducibility

8. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Centralized logging (ELK stack or similar)
   - Metrics collection (Prometheus/Grafana or similar)
   - Error tracking (Sentry or similar)
   - Health checks and alerting

### 1.3 Deployment Architecture with Dagger and Pipely

The deployment architecture will leverage Dagger for CI/CD pipelines and Pipely for CDN capabilities:

1. **Dagger CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Build, test, and deploy services as containers
   - Automate infrastructure provisioning
   - Implement security scanning and compliance checks
   - Enable blue/green deployments for zero-downtime releases

2. **Pipely CDN Integration**
   - Serve static assets (Web UI, documentation) through CDN
   - Implement caching strategies for analysis reports
   - Optimize global content delivery for better user experience

3. **Multi-Cloud Support**
   - Kubernetes manifests for container orchestration
   - Terraform modules for infrastructure provisioning
   - Helm charts for service deployment and configuration

## 2. Component Interaction Flows

### 2.1 Content Submission Flow

1. User uploads content via Web UI, mobile app, CLI, or API
2. API Gateway authenticates and validates the request
3. Ingestion Service performs initial validation (file type, size)
4. Content is stored in Object Storage with metadata recorded in PostgreSQL
5. Ingestion Service notifies Analysis Orchestration Service
6. Analysis Orchestration Service creates analysis task in the queue

### 2.2 AI Analysis Flow

1. Worker processes pick up analysis tasks from the queue
2. Analysis Orchestration Service dispatches task to relevant AI Service
3. AI Service retrieves content from Object Storage
4. Multiple HuggingFace models process the content in parallel
5. Results are processed, fused, and scored for authenticity
6. Analysis results are stored in PostgreSQL
7. Reporting Service is notified of completion

### 2.3 Reporting and Notification Flow

1. Reporting Service compiles detailed analysis report from database
2. Notification Service sends alerts to user (email, in-app)
3. User accesses report via Web UI, mobile app, or API
4. Reporting Service retrieves and presents compiled report

### 2.4 MLOps Flow

1. New data is collected and versioned with DVC
2. Model training pipeline is triggered (scheduled or event-based)
3. Experiments are tracked and versioned with MLflow
4. Best performing models are registered in MLflow Model Registry
5. Model deployment pipeline deploys new models to production
6. Performance monitoring tracks model metrics in production
7. Alerts are triggered for performance degradation or drift

### 2.5 Dagger CI/CD Flow

1. Code changes are pushed to version control
2. GitHub Actions trigger Dagger pipelines
3. Dagger builds and tests services in parallel
4. Security scanning and compliance checks are performed
5. Container images are pushed to registry
6. Dagger orchestrates deployment to staging environment
7. Automated tests are run against staging
8. Manual approval triggers production deployment
9. Blue/green deployment strategy ensures zero downtime
