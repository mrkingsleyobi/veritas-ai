## 2. Dagger Integration

### 2.1 Dagger CI/CD Pipelines

Dagger provides a programmable CI/CD platform that enables us to:
- Define pipelines as code using familiar programming languages
- Ensure consistent execution across local, CI, and production environments
- Leverage full type safety and automatic caching
- Integrate with existing tools and services

#### Core Dagger Workflows

1. **Build Pipeline**
   ```python
   # Example Dagger pipeline for building services
   def build_service(client: Client, source: Directory) -> Container:
       return (
           client.container()
           .from_("python:3.9")
           .with_directory("/src", source)
           .with_workdir("/src")
           .with_exec(["pip", "install", "-r", "requirements.txt"])
           .with_exec(["python", "setup.py", "build"])
       )
   ```

2. **Test Pipeline**
   ```python
   # Example Dagger pipeline for testing
   def test_service(client: Client, source: Directory) -> Container:
       return (
           client.container()
           .from_("python:3.9")
           .with_directory("/src", source)
           .with_workdir("/src")
           .with_exec(["pip", "install", "-r", "requirements.txt"])
           .with_exec(["pip", "install", "-r", "test-requirements.txt"])
           .with_exec(["pytest", "-v"])
       )
   ```

3. **Deploy Pipeline**
   ```python
   # Example Dagger pipeline for deployment
   def deploy_service(client: Client, image: Container, env: str) -> str:
       return (
           client.container()
           .from_("alpine:latest")
           .with_exec(["apk", "add", "kubectl"])
           .with_exec(["kubectl", "config", "use-context", env])
           .with_exec(["kubectl", "set", "image", "deployment/veritasai", f"veritasai={image}"])
       )
   ```

   sub vcl_recv {
       if (req.url ~ "^/api/") {
           return (pass);
       }
       if (req.http.Authorization) {
           return (pass);
       }
       return (hash);
   }
   
   sub vcl_backend_response {
       if (bereq.url ~ "^/reports/") {
           set beresp.ttl = 1h;
       }
       if (bereq.url ~ "^/assets/") {
           set beresp.ttl = 1d;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Deployment with Dagger**
   ```python
   # Deploy Pipely configuration
   def deploy_cdn(client: Client, config: Directory) -> Service:
       return (
           client.container()
           .from_("pipely/pipely:latest")
           .with_directory("/config", config)
           .with_exec(["pipely", "deploy", "--config", "/config/pipely.vcl"])
           .as_service()
       )
   ```

   def deploy_to_fly(client: Client, image: str) -> str:
       return fly.deploy(fly.DeployOpts(
           app="veritasai-prod",
           image=image,
           config=client.host().directory("./fly"),
           token=client.set_secret("fly_api_token", "...")
       ))
   ```

## 5. GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows

### 5.1 Workflow Orchestration

GitHub Actions workflows coordinate with Dagger to provide:
- Automated testing on every pull request
- Continuous deployment to staging environments
- Manual deployment triggers for production
- Automated security scanning and compliance checks

#### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: dagger/dagger@v2
        with:
          verb: call
          module: ./ci/test
          args: '--source=.'

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: dagger/dagger@v2
        with:
          verb: call
          module: ./ci/build
          args: '--source=.'

  deploy-staging:
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: dagger/dagger@v2
        with:
          verb: call
          module: ./ci/deploy
          args: '--env=staging'

  deploy-production:
    needs: deploy-staging
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: dagger/dagger@v2
        with:
          verb: call
          module: ./ci/deploy
          args: '--env=production'
```

### 5.2 Agentic CI/CD Architecture

The agentic CI/CD architecture enables:
- Self-healing pipelines that automatically retry failed steps
- Intelligent routing based on code changes
- Automated performance optimization
- Predictive failure detection

#### Key Components

1. **Pipeline Intelligence Agent**
   - Analyzes code changes to determine affected services
   - Optimizes test execution based on change impact
   - Predicts potential failures and suggests mitigations

2. **Deployment Orchestration Agent**
   - Manages blue/green deployments
   - Monitors deployment health and performance
   - Automatically rolls back failed deployments

3. **Security Compliance Agent**
   - Scans for vulnerabilities in real-time
   - Ensures compliance with security policies
   - Automatically blocks non-compliant deployments

4. **Resource Optimization Agent**
   - Monitors resource utilization
   - Suggests scaling adjustments
   - Optimizes cost without sacrificing performance

## 6. Deployment Strategies

### 6.1 Blue/Green Deployment

1. **Preparation**
   - Deploy new version to green environment
   - Run comprehensive tests on green environment
   - Validate functionality and performance

2. **Switch**
   - Update load balancer to route traffic to green
   - Monitor metrics and user feedback
   - Keep blue environment as rollback option

3. **Cleanup**
   - After successful validation, decommission blue
   - Prepare blue as new standby environment

### 6.2 Canary Deployment

1. **Initial Rollout**
   - Route 5% of traffic to new version
   - Monitor key metrics and error rates
   - Gradually increase traffic percentage

2. **Progressive Rollout**
   - Increase to 25%, then 50%, then 75%
   - Monitor at each stage
   - Pause or rollback if issues detected

3. **Full Rollout**
   - Route 100% of traffic to new version
   - Decommission old version after stabilization

## 7. Monitoring and Observability

### 7.1 Deployment Monitoring

- **Health Checks**: Automated service health validation
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, throughput, error rates
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **User Experience**: Page load times, API response times

### 7.2 Alerting and Notification

- **Critical Alerts**: Service outages, performance degradation
- **Warning Alerts**: Resource constraints, unusual patterns
- **Info Alerts**: Deployment completion, scaling events

### 7.3 Rollback Procedures

1. **Automatic Rollback**
   - Triggered by health check failures
   - Reverts to previous known good version
   - Notifies team of rollback event

2. **Manual Rollback**
   - Initiated by team member
   - Provides detailed rollback options
   - Preserves rollback audit trail

## 8. Security and Compliance

### 8.1 Secure Deployment Practices

- **Image Signing**: All container images are signed and verified
- **Secrets Management**: Secure storage and injection of secrets
- **Network Security**: Private networks and secure communication
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to deployment systems

### 8.2 Compliance Automation

- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated compliance checking
- **Audit Trails**: Complete deployment history and changes
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated generation of compliance reports

This deployment and CI/CD strategy ensures that VeritasAI can be reliably deployed across multiple platforms while maintaining security, performance, and scalability.
