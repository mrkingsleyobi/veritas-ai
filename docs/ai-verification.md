# AI Verification and Deepfake Detection

The VeritasAI platform includes advanced AI-powered content verification and deepfake detection capabilities to help combat digital misinformation.

## Content Verification Engine

The content verification engine analyzes various types of content to assess their authenticity and detect potential misinformation.

### Supported Content Types

- **Text Content** (`text/plain`, `text/html`): Analyzes text for misinformation patterns, sensational language, and credibility indicators
- **Image Content** (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`): Examines image metadata and EXIF data for authenticity indicators
- **Video Content** (`video/mp4`): Performs basic video analysis (requires deepfake detection for detailed analysis)
- **JSON Content** (`application/json`): Validates structured data and checks for source attribution

### Verification Process

The verification engine performs several checks:

1. **Misinformation Pattern Detection**: Identifies sensational language, absolute claims, vague authority references, and fear-mongering terms
2. **Credibility Assessment**: Looks for source attribution, evidence indicators, temporal information, and balanced language
3. **Metadata Analysis**: Examines content metadata for consistency and authenticity indicators
4. **Cross-Referencing**: Checks content against trusted sources when possible

  }
}
```

## Deepfake Detection

The deepfake detection engine identifies potential deepfake content in images and videos.

### Supported Formats

- **Images**: JPEG, PNG
- **Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV

### Detection Process

The deepfake detection engine performs several checks:

1. **Metadata Consistency**: Analyzes EXIF data for inconsistencies that may indicate manipulation
2. **Quality Analysis**: Examines image/video quality for signs of AI generation
3. **Artifact Detection**: Looks for compression artifacts and other indicators of digital manipulation
4. **Facial Analysis**: (In advanced implementations) Analyzes facial features and movements for anomalies

### API Endpoints

#### Detect Deepfake
```
POST /api/v1/ai/deepfake-detect?content_id={id}
```
Detects deepfake content in a specific content item.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "content_id": 123,
  "deepfake_detection": {
    "analysis_id": "def456",
    "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
