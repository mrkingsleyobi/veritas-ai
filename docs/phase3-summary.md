# Phase 3: ML Model Integration & Real-time Processing

## Overview
Phase 3 of the VeritasAI project focuses on integrating advanced machine learning models and implementing real-time processing capabilities. This phase builds upon the AI verification foundation established in Phase 2 to provide more sophisticated content analysis, continuous verification capabilities, and scalable processing for high-volume data streams.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced ML Model Integration
- **Enhanced Text Analysis Models**: Implemented advanced natural language processing models for deeper text content analysis
- **Improved Image Analysis**: Enhanced image verification with more sophisticated deepfake detection algorithms
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Developed models for cross-referencing content with trusted sources
- **Model Management System**: Created a custom model loading and caching system for efficient ML model inference

### 2. Real-time Processing Pipeline
- **Streaming Data Processing**: Implemented WebSocket support for real-time data streaming
- **Continuous Content Verification**: Built pipeline for continuous verification of streaming content
- **Async Processing**: Utilized asyncio for non-blocking processing of high-volume data
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed architecture to handle increasing data loads efficiently

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **ML Model Inference Optimization**: Improved performance of ML model predictions
- **Memory Management**: Enhanced memory usage for ML models and real-time processing
- **Caching Strategies**: Implemented intelligent caching for frequently accessed models and data
- **Resource Monitoring**: Added monitoring for system resources during real-time processing
