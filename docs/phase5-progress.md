# Phase 5 Progress Summary

## Completed Mobile Application Foundation

### 1. Development Environment Setup
- Created simplified React Native project structure
- Installed core dependencies (React, React Native, Axios)
- Set up navigation dependencies (@react-navigation/native, @react-navigation/stack)
- Configured Metro bundler for development

### 2. Basic App Structure
- Created main App component with navigation container
- Implemented SafeAreaProvider for proper UI layout
- Set up directory structure:
  - `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `src/screens/` - Screen components
  - `src/navigation/` - Navigation setup
  - `src/services/` - API services
  - `src/utils/` - Utility functions
  - `src/assets/` - Images, icons, fonts

### 3. Core Screens Implementation
- **LoginScreen**: User authentication with email/password
- **RegisterScreen**: New user registration
- **HomeScreen**: Dashboard with analytics summary and feature navigation
- **VerificationScreen**: Content verification interface

### 4. API Integration

- Logout functionality

### 6. Core Content Management
- Content verification interface with type selection
- URL input validation
- Loading states and error handling
- Mock analytics dashboard

## Next Steps

### Web UI Enhancement

4. Add accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 compliance)

### Testing and Deployment
1. Set up iOS and Android development environments
2. Test on device simulators
3. Implement unit and integration tests
4. Prepare for app store deployment
