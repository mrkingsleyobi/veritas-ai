# VeritasAI Phase 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 3 of the VeritasAI project focuses on implementing advanced machine learning capabilities and real-time processing features to enhance content verification and user experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced Machine Learning Model Integration

#### ML Model Architecture
- **Abstract Base Class**: `src/ai/ml/model.py` provides a foundation for all ML models with standardized methods for loading, prediction, and training
- **Text Analysis Model**: `src/ai/ml/models/text_analysis.py` implements BERT-based analysis for detecting misinformation patterns
- **Image Analysis Model**: `src/ai/ml/models/image_analysis.py` implements ResNet-50-based analysis for deepfake detection
- **Model Manager**: `src/ai/ml/manager.py` provides versioning, A/B testing, and performance monitoring capabilities

#### Key Features
- Model versioning system with support for multiple versions of each model type
- A/B testing capabilities for comparing model performance
- Performance monitoring and tracking of model accuracy
- Standardized API for model loading, prediction, and training
- Preprocessing and postprocessing pipelines for consistent data handling

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/ml/analyze-text` - Text content analysis
- `POST /api/v1/ml/analyze-image` - Image content analysis
- `GET /api/v1/ml/models` - List available models and active versions
- `POST /api/v1/ml/models/{model_type}/load` - Set active model version
- `POST /api/v1/ml/train` - Train models with new data (admin only)
- `GET /api/v1/ml/models/{model_type}/performance` - Get model performance metrics

### 2. Real-time Processing Capabilities

#### WebSocket Architecture
- **Connection Manager**: `src/realtime/websocket/manager.py` handles WebSocket connections and user subscriptions
- **WebSocket Manager**: High-level manager with built-in message handling capabilities
- **Authentication**: JWT token validation for all WebSocket connections

#### WebSocket Endpoints
- `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws/notifications` - Real-time notifications about content verification results
- `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws/analysis/{content_id}` - Real-time updates for specific content analysis
- `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws/dashboard` - Live updating of analytics and statistics

#### Streaming Content Processing
- **Streaming Processor**: `src/realtime/streaming/processor.py` handles real-time analysis of live content streams
- **Content Types**: Support for text streams and video streams (easily extensible to other types)
- **Processors**: Registerable processors for different content types with async processing capabilities

#### Streaming API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/stream/start` - Start a streaming content processing session
- `POST /api/v1/stream/chunk/{stream_id}` - Process a chunk of streaming content
- `POST /api/v1/stream/stop/{stream_id}` - Stop a streaming content processing session
- `GET /api/v1/stream/status/{stream_id}` - Get the status of a streaming process
- `POST /api/v1/stream/live-text` - Analyze a chunk of live text stream

### 3. Testing and Documentation

#### Comprehensive Test Suite
- Unit tests for all ML model components
- Unit tests for real-time processing components with proper async handling
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock-based testing to ensure reliability without external dependencies

#### Documentation
- Detailed documentation for ML features in `docs/ml-features.md`
- Comprehensive documentation for real-time processing in `docs/realtime-processing.md`
